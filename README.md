# GLAB 320H.8.1 - React Router App(Cryptocurrencies)

Learning Objectives
After completing this lab, learners will be able to:

Create a "multi-page" React application using BrowserRouter.
Fetch and handle data from an external API in React.

Using React Router
We will be creating a "multi-page" application that displays the prices for common crypto-currencies.

To get started, create a new React app within a project folder, as follows:

Run command npx create-react-app cryptoprices.
cd into the cryptoprices folder.
Run npm install react-router-dom; this is the package that will facilitate our route creation.
Delete the contents of the src folder and add blank files for index.js, App.js, and style.css.
Run npm start to start the development server.
